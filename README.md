# Loan Status Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Loan Status Prediction** project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various financial and demographic factors. This model helps financial institutions make better lending decisions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Pandas** 🏗️
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **Seaborn** 📊

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Loan Amount
- Applicant Income
- Credit History
- Marital Status
- Property Area
- Employment Status  
... and more.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature selection and engineering
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Correlation analysis

## 🏗️ Model Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy Score**    

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satishnaidu2633/Loan-status-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-status-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open **Loan Status Prediction.ipynb** and execute the cells.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Implement additional models like Random Forest or XGBoost
